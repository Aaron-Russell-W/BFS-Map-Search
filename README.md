# BFS-Map-Search

A BFS search using pixels on an map image to determine the shortest path between two points on the map. Two images are presented, one black and white and another colored map. 
The user chooses two points on the black and white map by clicking and then presses the "Bloom button" this shows how the BFS managed to get to the shortest point. 
The user then pushes the "Path" button to build a line on the colored map showing exactly the shortest path between both points.

### Things to do:
```
Clean up GUI.
Highlight points more clearly
Instructions within program how to get shortest path.
```
